    <h2>The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep</h2>

    <p>I really like this movie because it is an action movie with cool animation. At first this is the 
        that i can't really finish because I watched this in Cristmas and we were super busy preparing.
        I really like the plot and also the characters. </p>

    <h2>Zootopia</h2>
        <video controls width="500px">
            <source src="../Assets/Videos/Zootopia_Official_Teaser_Trailer_1_2016_-_Disney_Animated_Movie_HD_1080p.mp4" type= "video/mp4">
        </video>
    <p>Although this movie is "for kids" as they, if they view it in the wide range it talks about greatly about politics. This
        movie greatly impacted our views and opinions that not everyone in that position is great some are just wearing a mask.  </p>
    <h2>Mufasa The Lion King</h2>
        <video controls width="500px">
            <source src="../Assets/Videos/Mufasa_The_Lion_King_Official_Trailer_480p.mp4" type= "video/mp4">
        </video>
    <p>This movie is really understandable, how villains are created and sometimes showing kindness to the wrong people can backlash. 
       This movie taught me to listen to my parents because they do only the best to you.
    </p>
     <h2>A Tale of a thousand stars</h2>
        <video controls width="500px">
            <source src="../Assets/Videos/_Official_Trailer_1000stars_1080P.mp4" type= "video/mp4">
        </video>
    <p>I really like this because the actors are so great at acting. This also taught me a lot of lesson that you should
        be honest in the first place.  </p>
    <h2>The Untamed</h2>
        <video controls width="500px">
            <source src="../Assets/Videos/The Untamed (陈情令) _ Ultimate Trailer.mp4" type= "video/mp4">
        </video>
    <p>This movie was my pastime when there was covid. This movie hits different when you saw it on Covid because you can greatly
        focus on the plot and understand every characters. I really do recommend this one, because it is a great move, the graphics 
        are great and the actors coveys the characters very clearly.
