    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p> Rushiel Usman is an 18-year-old first-year student at Western Mindanao State University’s External Studies Unit (ESU) in Ipil Campus,
        pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science. It's been 18 years since <a href="./activity3.html">she was born </a> at Purok Azucena
        Kitabog, Titay, Zamboanga Sibugay. Her educational journey began at Kitabog Elementary School, followed by her Junior High School studies at Titay National High School,
        and she completed her Senior High School education at Ipil Shepherd Montessori Center. While she admits she is not among the 
        top-performing students and often struggles to keep up with her schoolwork, she remains driven by a clear goal she is determined 
        to achieve.</p>
 
    <p> Rushiel was 14 years old when her father passed away unexpectedly due to cancer, leaving her mother Premalin Usman, her sister 
        Roselyn, and herself. That year marked the saddest period of her life she could not bring herself to celebrate Christmas, as the 
        holiday only reminded her of how complete their family once was and how things would never be the same again. Despite this immense 
        loss, her mother showed remarkable perseverance, working tirelessly to provide for the family and ensure both daughters received 
        a quality education. Her sister Roselyn has since graduated with a degree in Business Management from Dr. Aurellio Mendoza Colleges.
        Rushiel is deeply grateful for her family’s unwavering support, as they have stood by her and her sister through every challenge 
        and triumph.</p>
        
    <p> Rushiel describes herself as someone who was not born to be a leader, but she takes great responsibility when assigned tasks.
        If she believes she can accomplish something, she will dedicate herself fully and persevere until the work is done. However, 
        she acknowledges that she tends to give up easily when faced with obstacles that feel heavy or when she realizes she 
        cannot meet the demands of a task. Even so, with her family’s encouragement and her own determination to reach her goals, she 
        continues to push forward in her academic journey and personal growth.</p>
