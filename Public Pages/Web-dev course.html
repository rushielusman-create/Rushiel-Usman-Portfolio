<h2>HYPER TEXT MARK UP LANGUAGE (HTML)</h2>

<h3>Is responsible of the content of the website</h3>

<p>First paragraph. HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to 
    create and structure content on the web. It provides the basic building blocks for webpages by 
    defining elements like headings, paragraphs. links, images, and multimedia. HTML uses a system of 
    tags and attributes to mark up content, enabling browsers to interpret and render it 
    visually for users. For example, the p tag defines a paragraph, while the a tag creates hyperlinks, 
    making HTML the backbone of web navigation and content presentation. HTML is a 
    foundational technology of the web and work seamlessly with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for 
    styling and JavaScript for interactivity. It is designed to be both human-readable and 
    machine-interpretable, allowing developers to build structured documents. With advancements 
    like HTML5, the language has incorporated support for rich media, such as video, audio, and 
    interactive elements, without requiring additional plugins. This has made HTML more versatile and 
    integral to modern web development. </p>

<h2>CASCADING STYLE SHEET (CSS)</h2>

<h3>Is responsible of the style of the Website</h3>

<p>Second paragraph. Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe the visual 
    presentation of a document written in markup language like HTML.  CSS allows developers to separate 
    content from design by specifying styles such as colors, fonts, layout, and spacing. This separation enables more 
    efficient and consistent design management, as changes to styles can be made in one place and applied 
    accross multiple  pages or elements. CSS operates in a cascading manner, meaning that styles can be layered and prioritize
    based o rules of inheritance and specificity, giving developers fine-grained control over the appearance
    of web content. CSS is an essential part of modern development because it enhances the user 
    experience by making web pages visually appealing and interactive. it supports the responsive design, 
    enabling websites to adapt seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes. Additionally, CSS can 
    be applied inline (within HTML elements), internally (in the style tag), or xternally (via linked 
    .css files), with external stylesheets being the most common and scalable approach. Advance features of CSS, such as animations, transitions, and 
    grid or flexbox layouts, allow developers to create dynamic and sophisticated web designs without 
    relying heavily on JavaScript. </p>

<h2>JAVASCRIPT (JS)</h2>

<h3>Is responsible of the functionality of the website</h3>

<p>JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily designed for creating 
    interactive and dynamic web applications. It is the core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside 
    HTML and CSS, enabling developers to build responsive user interfaces and add interactive features 
    such as animations, form validations, and real-time updates. JavaScript is executed in web browsers, 
    allowing it to modify the content and behavior of web pages without needing to reload them. This 
    client-side capability has made it indispensable for modern web development. Beyond the browser, 
    JavaScript has expanded its reach with platform like Node.js, which allows developers to write 
    server-side code. This versatility has transformed JavaScript into a full-stack language capable 
    of handling both front-end and back-end development. Additionally, it supports numerous
    frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which streamline the development 
    process and help create future-rich applications. Its ability to work accross platforms and 
    its continuous evolution have made JavaScript one of the most popular programming languages 
    in the world. </p>
